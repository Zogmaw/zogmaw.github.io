# Problem

I've got a semi-reasonable home network going now, but it's only available when I'm at home.  If you want to be able to access your home network when you're elsewhere, you've got two main options: a VPN or a reverse proxy.  I do currently have [wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) set up on my home network so I can access it from elsewhere, but if I want to allow others access to some of what I'm hosting without giving them full access to my network, a reverse proxy is the choice.  Plus, I've never set one up before so it'll be a fun exercise.

# Materials

Like most of my home network, I'll host this on my raspberry Pi 3b.  The software we'll be using is called [NGINX](https://nginx.org/), which I recently learned is actually pronounced "engine x" and not "ningks".

# Guide

## Installing Nginx

Just like 99% of other applications, we'll use the package manager
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```



`*/5 * * * * curl "https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=<domain>&token=<token>&verbose=true" > /dev/null 2>&1`
